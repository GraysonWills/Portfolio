# UX/UI Overhaul Skill

Deliver a full redesign plan and mockup package without breaking existing behavior.

## Workflow

1. Inventory current experience.
   - Map routes, page sections, core interactions, and content containers.
   - Explicitly mark what must remain unchanged.

2. Build a personalization brief.
   - Capture user identity, values, and differentiators.
   - Convert these into visual principles and constraints.

3. Define the design system.
   - Create color tokens, type scale, spacing, motion, and component rules.
   - Avoid generic default aesthetics.

4. Produce reviewable mockups.
   - Preferred: Figma frames when Figma tools are available.
   - Fallback: high-fidelity HTML/CSS artboards with clear frame labels.

5. Map redesign to current functionality.
   - Confirm each existing feature is represented in the new layout.
   - List zero-schema-change assumptions and compatibility boundaries.

6. Gate implementation behind approval.
   - Present an approval checklist.
   - Do not rewrite production UI until approved.

## Output Contract

Produce all of the following:
1. `brand-system.md`
2. `mockup` artifacts (Figma or HTML/CSS)
3. `figma-handoff.md` (even when Figma is not connected)
4. `approval-checklist.md`
5. `blog-authoring-improvements.md` when a writing/editor workflow exists

## References

- Use `references/overhaul-checklist.md` for quality gates.
- Use `assets/templates/figma-brief-template.md` when generating a Figma handoff package.
