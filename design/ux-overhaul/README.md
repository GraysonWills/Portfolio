# UX/UI Overhaul Review Package

This package proposes a full visual and interaction overhaul for the portfolio ecosystem while preserving current content models and feature behaviors.

## Design Direction

- Theme name: **Kinetic Atlas**
- Core intent: engineer-grade clarity + athletic movement energy
- Personal anchors used in styling:
  - Houston heat and color energy
  - Austin/Purdue technical rigor
  - Detroit industrial precision + GM blue influence
  - Athletic identity (baseball, taekwondo, spikeball, rope flow, mobility)

## Scope Guardrails

1. Keep existing content fields and page types intact.
2. Keep existing data flows intact (Redis schema, page routes, editor save model).
3. Focus changes on UI structure, visual language, and authoring ergonomics.
4. Defer implementation in production code until design approval.
