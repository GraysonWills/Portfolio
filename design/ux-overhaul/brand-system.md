## Typography

1. Subtle elevation + translation on hover for cards and list items.
2. Progressive reveal for stacked sections.
3. Avoid exaggerated micro-animations on core reading/writing surfaces.

## Component Character

1. Rounded geometry with disciplined radii (`12/18/26px`).
2. High-contrast badges and chips for metadata (skills, tags, statuses).
3. Reusable panel anatomy: header strip, section container, lightweight metrics cards.

## Accessibility Targets

1. Preserve keyboard flows and visible focus states.
2. Keep contrast at or above WCAG AA for body text and controls.
3. Avoid color-only communication for critical states.
